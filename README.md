This project brings the power of large language models directly to your documents. It leverages a GPU-accelerated Mistral-7B model within a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The result is a high-performance application that can instantly synthesize accurate, context-aware answers from any uploaded PDF.
